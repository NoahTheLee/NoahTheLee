Howdy howdy, I'm @NoahTheLee, a student studying Computer Science and Data Sciences - with a concentration in Cyber Security - at California Baptist University.
**Langs**: I'm learning Java right now and have a decent grasp on C++

I play lots of games:
  Right now, I'm playing mostly Elite Dangerous and Devil May Cry 5 on XBOX.
  I'm not much of a PC gamer, but I enjoy playing YOMI Hustle and MGR:R and Minecraft
I watch lots of stuff:
  YouTube for the brain rotting and some anime on the side.
  Various things in all fields, lots of brain rotting stuff on YouTube and Let's Plays of series
  I mostly watch action anime, big booms make my two braincells clatter together
I do some writing on the side:
  Short stories for the most part and text-based roleplaying through Discord.
  Actual TBRPing has stagnated a bit for me, no time to do anything super complex.
  I write here and there, couple of stories...
    Currently working on a project I've called "TRACE: DEADLOCK", nerdy ass that I am, that's a big acronym: Tactical Record Accounting Capture Encounters: Describing Events And Details of Location, Operation, Crew, and Kills
And I run DND for my friends.
  Despite how big my campaigns kinda go, I haven't ever seriously gone through the PHB or DMG.
  Pretty much everything I do I run entirely by the seat of my pants.
  I like making stuff up randomly, I MIGHT plan a little bit, but if I do, it's only a very small portion of the time I spend on the game.
  Yes, I am a MASSIVE nerd
I do plenty of literary stuff and enjoy writing or describing stories.
